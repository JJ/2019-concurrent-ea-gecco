	* utils/pop.R: Analyzing hung experiments, the best average number of evaluations is for pop=512; however, if we look at time it's worse than for pop=256. Too bad. 
	With pop-128, the max average evaluations per second are achieved, even bigger than for population=512. This does not follow any logical progression... Besides, it takes less time.

	* utils/chart.R: Two more experiments, or sets of experiments, should be proposed:
	1. Try with a generation gap of 16, to see if we achieve a slight improvement in the number of evaluations per second.
	2. Repeat all three experiments with other population sizes to account for lack of initial diversity.
