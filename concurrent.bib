abstract="This study describes an alternative concurrency approach in genetic algorithms. Inspiring from implicit parallelism in a physical chromosome, a vertical concurrency is introduced. Proposed gene process model allows genetic algorithms work in encodings independent from the gene position ordering in a chromosome. This feature is used to implement a gene reordering version of genetic algorithm. Further possible models of flexible gene position encodings are discussed.",

	Optimization Frameworks. As criteria for comparison a set of 271
	features grouped in 30 characteristics and 6 areas has been selected.
	These features include the different metaheuristic techniques covered,
	mechanisms for solution encoding, constraint handling, neighborhood
	specification, hybridization, parallel and distributed computation,
	software engineering best practices, documentation and user interface,
	etc. A metric has been defined for each feature so that the scores
	obtained by a framework are averaged within each group of features;
	leading to a final average score for each framework. Out of thirty
	three frameworks ten have been selected from the literature using
	well-defined filtering criteria, and the results of the comparison
	are analyzed with the aim of identifying improvement areas and gaps
	in specific frameworks and the whole set. Generally speaking, a significant
	lack of support has been found for hyper-heuristics, and par- allel
	and distributed computing capabilities. It is also desirable to have
	a wider implementation of some Software Engineering best practices.
	Finally, a wider sup- port for some metaheuristics and hybridization
	capabilities is needed.},

abstract="Evolutionary multi-agent systems (EMAS) play a critical role in many artificial intelligence applications that are in use today. In this paper, we present a new generic skeleton in Erlang for parallel EMAS computations. The skeleton enables us to capture a wide variety of concrete evolutionary computations that can exploit the same underlying parallel implementation. We demonstrate the use of our skeleton on two different evolutionary computing applications: (1) computing the minimum of the Rastrigin function; and (2) solving an urban traffic optimisation problem. We show that we can obtain very good speedups (up to 142.44                                                                          {\$}{\$}{\backslash}times {\$}{\$}                                                            {\texttimes}                                                       the sequential performance) on a variety of different parallel hardware, while requiring very little parallelisation effort.",

abstract = "Scalability issues might prevent Genetic Algorithms from being applied to real world problems. Exploiting parallelisation in the cloud might be an affordable approach to getting time efficient solutions that benefit of the appealing features of scalability, resource discovery, reliability, fault-tolerance and cost-effectiveness. Nevertheless, parallel computation is very prone to cause considerable overhead for communication. Also, making Genetic Algorithms distributed in an on-demand fashion is not trivial. Aiming at keeping under control the communication cost and, at the same time, supporting developers in the construction and deployment of parallel Genetic Algorithms, we designed and implemented a novel approach to distribute Genetic Algorithms in the form of a cloud-based application. It is based on the master/slave model, exploiting software containers, their cloud orchestration and message queues. We also devised a conceptual workflow covering each cloud Genetic Algorithms distribution phase, from resources allocation to actual deployment and execution, in an engineered fashion. Then, the application performance has been evaluated using a benchmark problem. According to the performance and setup times results, it emerged that the cloud can be considered a compelling way of scaling Genetic Algorithms and an excellent alternative to other technologies strictly related to the physically owned hardware."

Many optimum designs of tribological components are highly time-constrained before final productions. It is well-known that the process of a complex simulated design can be considerably accelerated by using some form of parallel computing. Also, for many tribological models additional assumptions can be relaxed with stricter design constrains, if the execution can be speeded up. In this study, the concurrent computing for tribological design is proposed, which is to perform parallel computing using the multitasking capability of today's operating system. In the concurrent computing a master program, which manages the process of the optimization, is used to launch a number of standalone slave programs (air bearing models) in a quick succession. And the operating system (MS-Windows) of the computer manages the parallel execution of the slave programs. Other than the standard programming language (Fortran 95) this approach uses none of the general parallel programming paradigms or directives, such as message passing interface, OpenMP, or coding using graphics processing units. In this study, the algorithm for the multiobjective optimization is group inching fortification method and the concurrent computing is executed in the algorithm-level. High parallel computing speedups are obtained in the simulated bearing designs. The approach can also be applied in using commercial general-purpose packages for modelling and self-coded methods for optimum design of tribological components or systems."

Moreover, various parallel architectures are taken into account. The performance assessment issue of parallel multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEA) is also presented. This work can be extended to any population-based metaheuristics such as particle swarm and scatter search."
